Omega (Ω) Notation:
Omega notation represents the lower bound or best-case scenario of an algorithm's performance. It provides the minimum growth rate required for the algorithm.

Theta (Θ) Notation:
Theta notation represents the average-case or tight bound of an algorithm's performance. It provides both the upper and lower bounds for the growth rate of the algorithm.

// make visuals hard-coded, make notes dynamic, and just get the number of sections, subsections, desc's, whatever
//          returned from json file, and just return that many components to the main home page or whatever


// create a init loading screen to store the user info first, so check if there is an auth cookie, and then dynamically call for the user info if that cookie exists

//need to figure out smart way to do home page,
// a. keep original idea and set valid urls inside the app
// b. do what we changed: create sep component pages and just use navlink to navigate around (also keep exports page and render smartly there)

//fix that issue, but now the smarter way would do it like openaiapi ref where they just throw every page at you and you can just scroll instead of only
//relying on the navbar. and as the user scrolls the navbar should highlight where you are at and open/close the respected folders of the page you're on

Explanation of how the algorithm works in more detail, step by step.

Pseudocode or code implementation of the algorithm in a specific programming language.

Discussion of the best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios for time complexity, along with explanations of why they occur.

Explanation of the stability of the algorithm. In the case of Merge Sort, it is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements is preserved after sorting.

Comparison with other sorting algorithms in terms of time complexity and space complexity. You can discuss scenarios where Merge Sort is more suitable compared to other sorting algorithms and vice versa.

Advantages and disadvantages of using Merge Sort. Mention its efficiency for large datasets due to its divide and conquer nature, but also highlight potential drawbacks, such as the extra space required for merging.

Practical use cases and applications of Merge Sort in real-world scenarios.

Examples of how to apply Merge Sort to different types of data, such as sorting arrays of integers, strings, or custom objects.

Tips for optimizing the algorithm in specific situations, if applicable.

Any additional insights, tips, or considerations that could be useful for someone trying to understand or implement Merge Sort.
